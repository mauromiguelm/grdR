# Estimating the drug response lag time in cancer cells

## Introduction

grdR is package that contains a method to estimate and study the drug onset time in cancer cell lines.
The package includes a model to (A) create synthetic data and (B) to estimate the
growth response delay (GRD) effect of a drug.
