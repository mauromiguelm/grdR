# tdsR: Estimating the drug response lag time in cancer cells

## Introduction

tdsR is package that contains a method to estimate and study the drug onset time in cancer cell lines.
The package includes a model to (A) create synthetic data and (B) to estimate the
temporal drug sensitivity (tds) effect of a drug. The package has been extensively
tested and I am currently working towards publishing it.
